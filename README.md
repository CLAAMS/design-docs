## Project/Office Location
An online system, but CLA IT is located in Anderson Hall 21, with a satellite location on the 6th floor of Weiss Hall
## Current system
At this time we use MS Word files created individually for each delivery, which are in turn scanned into PDF files and saved on a network share.
## Who would use the system?
### Are there other users besides yourself?
All CLA IT staff members will be using this system, there are 10 full time staff and approx. 15 student workers.
## Project Outline:
Automate the creation and retention of equipment sign-out sheets for items given out to faculty and staff in CLA by IT staff. The database should be divided into "permanently" assigned equipment which does not have a due date for return other than to say "end of life" of the technology, and into "term-based" assigned equipment which should be returned by a specific date. The latter should have a report for items not returned by the due date. Background on these terms used can be seen in the attached documents.
Attached is a Word document we fill out at each distribution of materials, and later scan it into a network share after being signed, the .PDF made by our Xerox machine is also attached. We would still like to keep using printouts for signing and also store the scan of the signed documents linked to the database as well (not in the database per se, a link would be fine).
The School of Media and Communications has a huge system for loaner equipment tracking, we are definitely not looking for that, but something much simpler. Running basic reports would be nice, but so would exporting the data to a .XLS for more robust sorting.
## Optional Features:
### Please list any additional items on your wish list for this system.
Online signatures.
## Expected Results of the Project
* Much better tracking and reporting of data.
*	Less paper.
