* What kind of information will the system need to store?  Will the fields be consistent across all inventory items, or will it be necessary that the users are able to customize assets?  Will the system need to collect and store any sensitive data?
* How will users interact with the system?  What is the current workflow, in detail?  What is the workflow you envision under the new inventory management system?
* Regarding reporting, what would the basic report look like?  Number of assets due back on a given day?  Number of assets past due?  Number of assets due back in X time period?  Is real time reporting and metrics a requirement of the system?
* Is there any technical difference between assets permanently assigned and those with a defined due date, other than accounting purposes?
* Will it be necessary for the system to retain historical data for all the assets and users, e.g. "User A has had assigned and subsequently returned Asset Z", or "Asset Y has been assigned and returned 5 times to Users B C D E and F, and been repaired once".
